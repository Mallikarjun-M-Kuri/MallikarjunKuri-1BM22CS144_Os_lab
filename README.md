# OPERATING SYSTEM-1BM22CS135
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-1</h1>
<h3>Write a C program to simulate the following non-pre-emptive CPU scheduling algorithm to find turnaround time and waiting time.
A) FCFS, B) SJF (pre-emptive & Non-preemptive).</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-2</h1>
<h3>Write a C program to simulate the following CPU scheduling algorithm to find turnaround time and waiting time.
A) Priority (pre-emptive & Non-pre-emptive), 
B) Round Robin (Experiment with different quantum sizes for RR algorithm)</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-3</h1>
<h3>Write a C program to simulate multi-level queue scheduling algorithm considering the following scenario. All the processes in the system are divided into two categories – system processes and user processes. System processes are to be given higher priority than user processes. Use FCFS scheduling for the processes in each queue.</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-4</h1>
<h3>Write a C program to simulate Real-Time CPU Scheduling algorithms:
a) Rate-Monotonic 
b) Earliest-deadline First
c) Proportional scheduling</h3>
